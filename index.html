    <h1>How America’s Diet Is Feeding the
        Groundwater Crisis</h1>

    <h2>As dinner tables and snack menus feature far more chicken and
        cheese, farms are expanding where water is scarce.</h2>

</div>

<div class="divider"></div>

<div class="text-container">

    <p>America’s striking dietary shift in recent decades, toward far more chicken and cheese, has
        not only contributed to concerns about American health but has taken a major,
        undocumented toll on underground water supplies.</p>

    <p>
        The effects are being felt in key agricultural regions nationwide as farmers have drained
        groundwater to grow animal feed.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Arkansas for example, where cotton was once king, the land is now ruled by fields of
        soybeans to feed the chickens, a billion or so of them, that have come to dominate the
        region’s economy. And Idaho, long famous for potatoes, is now America’s largest producer
        of alfalfa to feed the cows that supply the state’s huge cheese factories.
    </p>

    <p>
        Today alfalfa, a particularly water-intensive crop used largely for animal feed, covers 6
        million acres of irrigated land, much of it in the driest parts of the American West.
    </p>

    <p>
        These transformations are tied to the changing American diet. Since the early 1980s,
        America’s per-person cheese consumption has doubled, largely in the form of mozzarellacovered pizza pies.
        And last year, for the first time, the average American ate 100 pounds of
        chicken, twice the amount 40 years ago.
    </p>

    <p>
        It’s not just Americans eating more American-made meat and cheese. Exports of poultry
        and dairy have risen more than tenfold since 1980, thanks to America’s farming efficiency,
        combined withgovernment subsidies and rising demand from countries like China. Exports
        of animal feed itself have soared, too, industry datashow.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most of America’s irrigated farmland grows crops that don’t directly feed humans but
        instead are used to feed animals or to produce ethanol for fuel. And most of that irrigation
        water comes from aquifers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Those crops have expanded into areas that don’t have enough water to sustain them,
        affecting some important aquifers across the country by contributing to groundwater
        overuse. Aquifer depletion for animal feed is occurring in places including Texas, the
        Central Valley of California, the High Plains in Kansas, Arizona and other areas that lack
        enough water from rivers and streams to irrigate the crops.
    </p>

    <p>
        Irrigated acreage for corn, about half of which goes toward animal feed, jumped sixfold
        between 1964 and 2017, federal numbers show. Irrigated acres for soybean, mostly
        used for animals, has jumped eightfold.
    </p>

    <p>
        “The seemingly simple task of deciding what to eat is, in reality, intricately woven into a
        complex tapestry of interconnected factors,” said Mesfin Mekonnen, a professor of
        environmental engineering at the University of Alabama who studies the water footprint of
        food. While there’s been growing awareness of issues like greenhouse gas emissions from
        ranching and agriculture, he said, “water usage in food production is still an aspect that is
        not widely discussed.”
    </p>

    <p>
        The toll on aquifers, which supply 90 percent of America’s water systems, has been
        devastating. A Times investigation this year revealed that many of those aquifers are being
        severely overtaxed by agriculture and industry, and that the federal government has left
        oversight to the states, where tangles of rules are failing to protect those aquifers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Food choices have long led to debates not only about personal health, but also animal
        welfare, cultural expectations and the role of government regulations in shaping people’s
        diets. The damage that animal agriculture is doing to fragile aquifers, while less
        documented, is particularly important: The decline of the aquifers could affect what
        Americans eat, and potentially become a threat to America’s food supply.

    <h2>DAIRY FARMERS HEAD TO THE DESERT</h2>

    <p>
        In the early 1990s, dairy farmers in California found themselves increasingly squeezed by
        suburban sprawl, rising costs and regulations. Some began looking for a new place to set up
        shop, and the criteria were simple: Cheap, wide open land. Fewer rules. And access to
        plenty of water.
    </p>

    <p>
        For many farmers, the answer was easy.
    </p>

    <p>
        “We liked Idaho,” said Arie Roeloffs, who left California. He opened a dairy farm with his inlaws a hundred
        miles from Boise and is now vice president of the Idaho Dairymen’s
        Association.
    </p>

    <p>
        Idaho now has about 700,000 dairy cattle, more than any other state save California and
        Wisconsin. That shift has transformed the countryside. Drive across the high desert of
        southern Idaho, a mostly barren landscape of pale-brown sagebrush, and you’ll find
        sprawling cattle yards and emerald-green fields of alfalfa, grown to support one of the
        largest collections of dairy farms and cheese factories in the United States.
    </p>

    <p>
        The transformation is all the more striking for the harshness of the land. This part of Idaho,
        where the Snake River curves south and west around the Sawtooth Mountains, gets just 10
        inches of rain a year. Pumping groundwater has helped Idaho accommodate the influx of
        dairy farms and feed crops.
    </p>

    <p>
        Idahoans call this area the Magic Valley. “You put water to it,” said Steve Stuebner,
        spokesman for the Idaho Department of Water Resources, “and everything grows.”
    </p>

    <p>
        But more than four-fifths of monitoring wells in Idaho have shown a significant decrease in
        water levels since 1980, according to data compiled by The New York Times. Some 79
        percent of monitoring wells hit record lows in the past decade alone. Both figures are the
        highest in the country.
    </p>

    <p>
        The interplay between the Snake River and groundwater is complex, and there are several
        reasons that aquifer levels have been declining in recent decades, including not only
        overpumping but also changes in the way that farmers irrigate their fields. Nevertheless,
        today aquifer levels are far below where they were 50 years ago. And they continue to fall.
    </p>

    <p>
        “We’ve been using more water than we’ve been putting back into the aquifer,” said Brian E.
        Olmstead, a member of the Idaho Water Resource Board and a former farmer. “Everybody
        thought, this was such a huge resource, we can’t ever deplete it.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Since the 1990s, major international cheese producers like Glanbia of Ireland, Lactalis of
        France and Agropur of Canada have all bought or built processing plants in Idaho. Glanbia
        has four plants in the state, which use 4.3 billion pounds of milk a year.
